## Description

Tool developed for my Biology teacher at Parkland 
High School. It enables the students to enter the
type of roadkill they discovered on the road, and after
entering their data, it shows up on an interactive map 
showing where the roadkill was and the name of it. It also
features a list that shows all of the roadkills in the order
they were entered.
